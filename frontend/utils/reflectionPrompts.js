/**
 * Reflection Prompt Rotation System
 * 
 * This system ensures that the chatbot never asks the same reflection prompt
 * twice in a row by maintaining a history of recently used prompts.
 * 
 * Features:
 * - 20 unique reflection prompts with natural language variations
 * - Tracks last 8 used prompts to prevent immediate repetition
 * - Auto-resets after 30 minutes of inactivity
 * - Context-aware prompt selection based on conversation length
 * - Visual indicators showing rotation status
 * 
 * Usage:
 * - getReflectionPrompt() - Gets next available prompt
 * - getContextualReflectionPrompt(length) - Gets context-aware prompt
 * - resetReflectionPrompts() - Resets the rotation system
 * - getReflectionStatus() - Gets current system status
 * - getRotationVisual() - Gets visual representation of rotation
